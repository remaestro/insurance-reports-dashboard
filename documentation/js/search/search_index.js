cards and graphics. It was built on top of Google's Angular Framework and the HTML version of Paper Dashboard. It is a powerful dashboard but it is light and easy to be used. It has enough features to allow you to get the job done, but it is not crowded to the point where you can't find the files for a specific component.\n We like consistency and design that blends into its purpose. Paper Dashboard Angular is a perfect example of our most thoughtful work. It combines over a dozen components and plugins, while looking like everything fits together. For an easy start or inspiration for you project, we have also create a set of example pages, like the user settings or usage graphics.\n Paper Dashboard Angular is built using the same design language as Paper Kit, which you can use for the presentation pages of your website. You can easily use them together, or pick between them depending on the project you have.\n Example Pages We wanted to fully display the power of this dashboard, so the kit comes packed with examples showing you how to use the components.\nTable of Contents\n\nVersions\nDemo\nQuick Start\nDeploy\nDocumentation\nFile Structure\nBrowser Support\nResources\nReporting Issues\nTechnical Support or Questions\nLicensing\nUseful Links\n\nVersions\n \n \n \n\n\n\nHTML\nAngular\nReact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemo\n\n\n\nDashboard\nUser Profile\nTables\nIcons\nNotifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n View More.\nQuick start\nQuick start options:\n\nDownload from Creative Tim.\n\nDeploy\n:rocket: You can deploy your own version of the template to Genezio with one click:\n\nTerminal Commands\n\nInstall NodeJs from NodeJs Official Page.\nOpen Terminal\nGo to your file project\nRun in terminal: npm install -g @angular/cli\nThen: npm install\nAnd: ng serve\nNavigate to: http://localhost:4200/\n\nWhat's included\nWithin the download you'll find the following directories and files:\nExample :paper-dashboard-angular\n├── CHANGELOG.md\n├── ISSUES_TEMPLATE.md\n├── LICENSE.md\n├── README.md\n├── angular.json\n├── browserslist\n├── documentation\n│   └── tutorial-components.html\n├── e2e\n├── karma.conf.js\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── protractor.conf.js\n├── src\n│   ├── app\n│   │   ├── app.component.css\n│   │   ├── app.component.html\n│   │   ├── app.component.spec.ts\n│   │   ├── app.component.ts\n│   │   ├── app.module.ts\n│   │   ├── app.routing.ts\n│   │   ├── layouts\n│   │   │   └── admin-layout\n│   │   │       ├── admin-layout.component.html\n│   │   │       ├── admin-layout.component.scss\n│   │   │       ├── admin-layout.component.spec.ts\n│   │   │       ├── admin-layout.component.ts\n│   │   │       ├── admin-layout.module.ts\n│   │   │       └── admin-layout.routing.ts\n│   │   ├── pages\n│   │   │   ├── dashboard\n│   │   │   │   ├── dashboard.component.html\n│   │   │   │   └── dashboard.component.ts\n│   │   │   ├── icons\n│   │   │   │   ├── icons.component.html\n│   │   │   │   └── icons.component.ts\n│   │   │   ├── maps\n│   │   │   │   ├── maps.component.html\n│   │   │   │   └── maps.component.ts\n│   │   │   ├── notifications\n│   │   │   │   ├── notifications.component.html\n│   │   │   │   └── notifications.component.ts\n│   │   │   ├── table\n│   │   │   │   ├── table.component.html\n│   │   │   │   └── table.component.ts\n│   │   │   ├── typography\n│   │   │   │   ├── typography.component.html\n│   │   │   │   └── typography.component.ts\n│   │   │   ├── upgrade\n│   │   │   │   ├── upgrade.component.html\n│   │   │   │   └── upgrade.component.ts\n│   │   │   └── user\n│   │   │       ├── user.component.html\n│   │   │       └── user.component.ts\n│   │   ├── shared\n│   │   │   ├── fixedplugin\n│   │   │   │   ├── fixedplugin.component.html\n│   │   │   │   ├── fixedplugin.component.ts\n│   │   │   │   └── fixedplugin.module.ts\n│   │   │   ├── footer\n│   │   │   │   ├── footer.component.html\n│   │   │   │   ├── footer.component.ts\n│   │   │   │   └── footer.module.ts\n│   │   │   └── navbar\n│   │   │       ├── navbar.component.html\n│   │   │       ├── navbar.component.ts\n│   │   │       └── navbar.module.ts\n│   │   └── sidebar\n│   │       ├── sidebar.component.html\n│   │       ├── sidebar.component.ts\n│   │       └── sidebar.module.ts\n│   ├── assets\n│   │   ├── css\n│   │   ├── fonts\n│   │   ├── img\n│   │   └── scss\n│   │       ├── paper-dashboard\n│   │       └── paper-dashboard.scss\n│   ├── environments\n│   ├── favicon.ico\n│   ├── index.html\n│   ├── main.ts\n│   ├── polyfills.ts\n│   ├── styles.css\n│   ├── test.ts\n│   ├── tsconfig.app.json\n│   ├── tsconfig.spec.json\n│   └── typings.d.ts\n├── tsconfig.json\n└── tslint.jsonBrowser Support\nAt present, we officially aim to support the last two versions of the following browsers:\n    \nResources\n\nDemo: https://demos.creative-tim.com/paper-dashboard-angular/#/dashboard\nDownload Page: https://www.creative-tim.com/product/paper-dashboard-angular\nDocumentation: https://demos.creative-tim.com/paper-dashboard-angular/#/documentation/tutorial\nLicense Agreement: https://www.creative-tim.com/license\nSupport: https://www.creative-tim.com/contact-us\nIssues: Github Issues Page\n\nReporting Issues\nWe use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for the Paper Dashboard Angular.
